### Meteor tutorial

Great tutorial in my opinion to get the beginnings of Meteor down.

### This is a "for fun" project - might always be a work in progress, but it's coming along!

## Grab dependencies

as usual run `npm install` and  `bower install`

## Uses server.js file

Run `node server.js` to start
